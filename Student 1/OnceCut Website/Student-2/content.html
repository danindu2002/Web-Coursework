            <div class="actor-details">
                <p>Dwayne Douglas Johnson (born May 2, 1972), also known by his ring name the Rock, is an American
                    actor,
                    film producer, and retired professional wrestler. Widely regarded as one of the greatest
                    professional
                    wrestlers of all time, he was integral to the development and success of the World Wrestling
                    Federation
                    (WWF, now WWE) during the Attitude Era, an industry boom period in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
                    Johnson wrestled for the WWF for eight years prior to pursuing an acting career. His films have
                    grossed
                    over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him one of the world's
                    highest-grossing and highest-paid actors.</p>

                <p>After accepting an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Miami, he was a member
                    of
                    the 1991 national championship team, but largely was a backup player. Despite aspirations at
                    professional football he went undrafted in the 1995 NFL draft, and was briefly signed with the
                    Calgary
                    Stampeders before being cut in his first season. In 1996, Johnson's father Rocky assisted in helping
                    him
                    secure a contract with the WWF. Johnson quickly rose to global prominence, aided by a gimmick he
                    employed as a charismatic trash talker. Johnson left WWE in 2004 and returned in 2011 as a part-time
                    performer until 2013, making sporadic appearances until retiring in 2019. A 10-time world champion,
                    including the promotion's first of African-American descent, he is also a two-time Intercontinental
                    Champion, a five-time Tag Team Champion, the 2000 Royal Rumble winner, and WWE's sixth Triple Crown
                    champion. Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view (WrestleMania
                    XXVIII)
                    and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's flagship television series (Raw and
                    SmackDown).</p>

                <p>Johnson's first film role was in The Mummy Returns (2001). The following year he played his first
                    leading role in the action fantasy film The Scorpion King (2002). He has since starred in family
                    films
                    The Game Plan (2007), Race to Witch Mountain (2009), Tooth Fairy (2010), Jumanji: Welcome to the
                    Jungle
                    (2017), Jumanji: The Next Level (2019), and Jungle Cruise (2021), as well as the action films
                    Journey 2:
                    The Mysterious Island (2012), G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013), Hercules (2014), Skyscraper (2018), San
                    Andreas (2015) and Rampage (2018). He also starred in the action comedy films Get Smart (2008),
                    Central
                    Intelligence (2016), Baywatch (2017), and Red Notice (2021). His role as Luke Hobbs in the Fast &
                    Furious films, beginning with Fast Five (2011), helped the franchise become one of the
                    highest-grossing
                    in film. He joined the DC Extended Universe playing the titular role in Black Adam (2022). He is
                    also
                    known for voicing Maui in the Disney animated film Moana (2016).</p>

                <p>Johnson produced and starred in the HBO comedy-drama series Ballers (2015–2019), and the
                    autobiographical sitcom Young Rock (2021). In 2000, Johnson released his autobiography, The Rock
                    Says,
                    which was a New York Times bestseller. In 2012, he co-founded the entertainment production company
                    Seven
                    Bucks Productions. Johnson is a co-owner of the XFL, a professional American football league, which
                    he
                    acquired from WWE owner Vince McMahon for $15 million in 2020. In 2016 and 2019, Time named Johnson
                    one
                    of the world's most influential people.</p>
