                <h1>Green Book</h1>
                <p>
                    In 1962, while his nightclub is closed for repairs, fierce bouncer Frank "Tony Lip" Vallelonga 
                    looks for work. The most intriguing proposition ends up being Don Shirley, an African-American 
                    classical pianist, who needs a driver for a concert tour of the Deep South. Tony accepts the job 
                    despite having little enthusiasm for working for a Black guy, and they set out on their journey with 
                    "The Negro Motorist Green Book," a road safety manual for navigating America's racial segregation. 
                    Because of their divergent perspectives on life and ideals, the snobbishly scholarly pianist and the 
                    bluntly pragmatic bouncer can hardly get along. However, as the unlikely team travels through and endures 
                    America's horrifying injustices,they develop a fresh respect for one other's talents.In doing so, they 
                    nurture an understanding and a friendship that would change both their lives.

                <p>
                    The Kim family, made up of Chung-sook and Ki-taek and their children Ki-woo and Ki-jung, 
                    reside in a run-down apartment in one of Seoul's lower-working-class neighborhoods. Ki-woo, who aspires 
                    to attend college, is chosen by Min, a fellow student, to take over Park Da-hye's teaching duties. A 
                    affluent family named the Parks resides in a Namgoong-designed modernist home. Ki-woo is advised by Min 
                    to make up his schooling in order to land a job. Mrs. Park is searching for an art therapist for Da-song 
                    when Ki-woo learns about it, and Ki-woo suggests Ki-jung as the most gullible person.

                    The Kims will orchestrate the termination of the Parks' staff by replacing the current servants. 
                    The Parks' housekeeper Moon-gwang might be the most challenging to get rid of. How far the Kims will go 
                    in their attempt to impersonate the Parks is the key question.

                    Massachusetts' Gloucester. Ruby Rossi, a senior in high school, 
                    always has a lot on her plate because she is a Child of Deaf Adults and the only 
                    hearing member in her family. In fact, it can be too much for a teenager to try to balance 
                    education, social life, her father's fishing boat's backbreaking work, and the demands of her family. 
                    Ruby likes to sing, but do her parents realize this? When Ruby joins the school chorus, singing takes on 
                    a life of its own, and the gifted young woman is suddenly faced with a decision: should she spread her wings 
                    and pursue her dreams, or should she continue to fight daily battles as a member of the proud Rossi clan

                <h1>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h1>
                <p>
                    Overworked Evelyn Wang tries to deal with everything, including her strained relationships with her 
                    critical father Gong Gong and her daughter Joy. Her laundromat is on the verge of disaster, and her marriage to 
                    her cowardly husband Waymond is in trouble. She must also prepare herself for an uncomfortable encounter with Deirdre, 
                    the unkempt IRS auditor, an impersonal bureaucrat. But as the stern agent grows impatient, a mysterious multiverse 
                    fissure develops into an eye-opening investigation of alternate realms. Evelyn might go into the rabbit hole. In the 
                    universe, how many stars are there? Can worn-out Evelyn comprehend the unstoppable force of possibilities, use newly 
                    discovered abilities, and stop a villain from destroying the thin, innumerable layers of the invisible world?
