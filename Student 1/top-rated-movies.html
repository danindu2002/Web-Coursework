                <p>In a devastated Earth overrun by invincible predators of a possible extraterrestrial origin, the Abbotts are struggling to survive 
                    in the desolate urban jungle of New York City: a death trap defined by a new era of utter silence. Indeed, as noise attracts this new type of 
                    invader, even the slightest of sounds can be deadly. However, even though it's already been twelve months since the powerful monsters' first 
                    sightings, the resilient Abbott family still stands strong. In this muted dystopia, learning the rules of survival is crucial. And now, more 
                    than ever, the Abbotts must not make a sound.</p>
